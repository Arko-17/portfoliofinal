            <div class="line"></div>
            <p> My favorite movies are the Harry Potter Movies written by J.K Rowling. This story is about a boy named Harry who is famous for being in a prophecy in order to defeat the strongest and evil wizard from the 1930s. His name is Voldemort Riddle aka Lord Voldemort. He had killed Harry's parents who became an orphan. At the age of eleven, he is invited by a half giant to this magical school 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry' by Rubeus Hagrid. There, students are sorted into four houses namely Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. Theses series of books tell us about Harry's succes to defeat Voldemort and finally defeats him.
                My favorite book is Diary of a Wimpy Kid. In this story a middle-school kid, Gregory Heffley suffers it and tells this story to middle-schoolers and describes his life along with his home life.
